## üì∏ The problem 

Traditional collaboration software often fails to engage employees, especially those with ADHD, leading to decreased productivity and burnout. Existing tools lack the personalised incentives and supportive features needed to make teamwork enjoyable and motivating for neurodiverse individuals.

## Our solution 

Jimini revolutionises collaborative working in the work environment by gamifying productivity and tailoring the experience for individuals with ADHD. It provides a visually appealing and interactive platform where employees can earn rewards, track their achievements, and connect with colleagues in a virtual office environment. By simplifying task management and offering a "start random task" mode, Jimini removes decision-making barriers and fosters a sense of accomplishment.
